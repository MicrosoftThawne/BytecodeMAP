# Information
This is a simple Deserializer Manipulator.
It pushes scripts onto Roblox, for example this can push a Lua Virtual Machine onto Roblox and then let you call it and execute scripts using it. A good example of a Bytecode M.A.P (Bytecode Manipulator) is Rerubi or Seven X.
Rerubi uses Fi0ne Virtual Machine while Seven X uses a modified version of LBI.
